        <h3>Bipolar disorder</h3>
        <p>Bipolar disorder is a complex mental health condition that causes pronounced mood swings, alternating between manic highs and depressive lows. These mood changes can persist for days, weeks, or even months, significantly affecting everyday life, relationships, and overall well-being. Those affected can better manage the condition by gaining a deeper understanding of its symptoms, causes, and treatment options.



Types of Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder comes in several forms:

Bipolar I Disorder: This type is marked by at least one manic episode, often accompanied by depressive episodes. Manic episodes can be quite severe and may sometimes necessitate hospitalization.

Bipolar II Disorder: This involves a milder form of mania known as hypomania, along with major depressive episodes. Individuals with Bipolar II do not experience full-blown manic episodes.

Cyclothymic Disorder (Cyclothymia): This is a milder, chronic form of bipolar disorder where mood swings occur frequently but are less intense than those seen in Bipolar I or II.

Other Specified and Unspecified Bipolar Disorders: These categories include variations of bipolar symptoms that don’t neatly fit into the previous classifications.



 Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder

The symptoms of bipolar disorder vary based on whether a person is in a manic or depressive state.

Manic Episode Symptoms:

- Excessive energy, restlessness, or extreme irritability

- Racing thoughts and rapid speech

- Decreased need for sleep

- Heightened self-esteem or feelings of grandiosity

- Engagement in risky behaviours, such as reckless spending or unsafe sexual activities



Depressive Episode Symptoms:

- Ongoing sadness, feelings of hopelessness, or emptiness

- Fatigue and low energy

- Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities

- Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or oversleeping

- Difficulty concentrating and making decisions

- Suicidal thoughts or tendencies towards self-harm

Causes and Risk Factors: 

The exact cause of bipolar disorder remains unclear, but it is believed to stem from a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors.

Genetics: A family history of bipolar disorder can elevate the risk of developing it.

Brain Chemistry and Structure: Variations in brain function and neurotransmitter imbalances may play a significant role.

Environmental Triggers: Stressful life events, trauma, substance abuse, and major life changes can provoke episodes.

 Diagnosis and Treatment

Diagnosing bipolar disorder involves a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, reviewing medical history, and tracking symptoms over time. Because bipolar symptoms can overlap with other mental health conditions, obtaining an accurate diagnosis is essential.

Treatment Options:

Medication: Mood stabilizers (like lithium), antipsychotics, and antidepressants are commonly used to manage symptoms.

Therapy: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and psychotherapy can assist individuals in navigating mood swings and developing effective coping strategies.

Lifestyle Adjustments: Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, eating a balanced diet, and exercising regularly can be beneficial in managing symptoms.

Support Systems: Educating family members, joining support groups, and seeking therapy for loved ones can enhance understanding and coping strategies.

 Living with Bipolar Disorder: Managing bipolar disorder requires ongoing treatment and self-awareness. Recognizing mood shifts, steering clear of triggers, and sticking to a treatment plan can help individuals maintain stability. With the right support and care, those with bipolar disorder can lead fulfilling and productive lives. If you or someone you know is facing challenges, seeking professional help is a crucial step toward recovery.

<h3>Schizophrenia</h3>
        <p>
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects a person's thoughts, emotions, and behaviour. It's characterized by psychotic symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms.
The symptoms of psychosis can include hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder and movement disorder. Negative symptoms, on the other hand, may involve a loss of motivation, loss of interest, difficulty displaying emotions, and withdrawal from social life. Cognitive symptoms can also occur, involving attention, concentration, memory, and decision-making issues.
It's important to know that people may experience various symptoms related to different areas when dealing with mental health. These symptoms can be categorized as behavioural, cognitive, mood-related, psychological, speech-related, and other common symptoms. 
Behavioural symptoms include social isolation, disorganized behaviour, aggression, agitation, compulsive behaviour, excitability, hostility, repetitive movements, self-harm, or lack of restraint. 
Cognitive symptoms may include thought disorder, delusion, amnesia, a belief that an ordinary event has special and personal meaning, the belief that thoughts aren't one's own, disorientation, mental confusion, slowness in activity, or false belief of superiority. 
Mood-related symptoms may include anger, anxiety, apathy, feeling detached from oneself, general discontent, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, elevated mood, or inappropriate emotional response. 
Psychological symptoms may include hallucination, paranoia, hearing voices, depression, fear, persecutory delusion, or religious delusion. 
Speech-related symptoms may include circumstantial speech, incoherent speech, rapid and frenzied speaking, or speech disorder. 
Other common symptoms that people may experience include fatigue, impaired motor coordination, lack of emotional response, or memory loss.
The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown, however, a combination of genetic, environmental, and brain-related factors may contribute to its development. 

Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed through an objective diagnostic test. Instead, it is based on the observed behaviour of the person, their psychiatric history, and input from others who are familiar with them. To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, the described symptoms must have been present for at least six months. It is common for individuals with schizophrenia to also experience other mental disorders, such as substance use disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

The primary treatment for schizophrenia involves the use of antipsychotic medication. The first-generation antipsychotics, previously known as typical antipsychotics, work by blocking D2 receptors and affecting dopamine neurotransmission. The second-generation antipsychotics, also known as atypical antipsychotics, can also impact serotonin neurotransmission. While antipsychotics can reduce anxiety symptoms within hours, other symptoms may take several days or weeks to improve. Negative and cognitive symptoms may require additional therapies and medications. Since people have varying responses and tolerances to antipsychotics, there is no single antipsychotic that is suitable as a first-line treatment for everyone.

Treatment for certain conditions often requires a combination of lifelong medication, psychotherapy, and specialized care services. These services may include antipsychotic and anti-tremor therapies, support groups, rehabilitation programs, cognitive therapy, psychoeducation, family therapy, behaviour therapy, and group psychotherapy.

        <h3>Antimicrobial resistance</h3>
        <p> Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a mounting global health crisis, threatening the effectiveness of life-saving medicines and the future of modern medicine. Antimicrobial resistance refers to the ability of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites to withstand the effects of medications designed to kill or inhibit them. This resistance renders standard treatments ineffective, allowing infections to persist, spread, and cause increased morbidity and mortality.

Causes of Antimicrobial Resistance
Misuse and overuse of antimicrobials: The main causes of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) globally are the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in human medicine, animal husbandry, and agriculture, combined with poor infection prevention, environmental contamination, and global transmission pathways

Poor infection prevention: Inadequate hygiene and poor infection control in healthcare settings accelerate the spread of resistant strains.

Genetic adaptation and transmission: Microbes can acquire resistance genes naturally and share them with other organisms via horizontal gene transfer, spreading resistance rapidly within populations.

Global travel and trade: These contribute to the quick spread of resistant pathogens across borders.

Mechanisms of Resistance
Microorganisms employ several strategies to evade antimicrobial action:

Restricting drug entry or pumping drugs out of cells

Enzymatically destroying or altering drugs

Changing drug targets within the organism

Bypassing metabolic pathways targeted by drugs

Impact and Consequences
Health Impact: AMR is estimated to have directly caused 1.27 million deaths globally in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths overall. Forecasts predict up to 10 million annual deaths by 2050 if current trends continue.

Medical Procedure Risk: Infections that are harder or impossible to treat make surgeries, chemotherapy, and organ transplants riskier.

Economic Burden: AMR could add up to US$1 trillion in annual healthcare costs and US$1–3.4 trillion in GDP losses per year by 2030.

Global Disparities: Low- and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable, exacerbating health inequalities due to weaker healthcare infrastructure.

Solutions and Strategies
Stewardship and Education: Rational use of antimicrobials in healthcare and agriculture, healthcare workforce education, and public awareness.

Infection prevention: Improved sanitation, vaccination, and infection control in hospitals and communities.

Surveillance and Diagnostics: Enhanced data collection on AMR trends, investments in rapid diagnostics, and better tracking of antimicrobial use.

Research and Innovation: Development of new antibiotics, alternative therapies like bacteriophage treatment, with recent advances aided by artificial intelligence and fostering global partnerships to fund and regulate such innovations.

Global Action Plans: Implementation of coordinated national and international AMR action plans that address governance, legislation, and equitable access to new and existing treatments.

Antimicrobial resistance is a complex and rapidly escalating crisis that demands immediate, sustained, and coordinated global action. Only through multi-sectoral collaboration combining prudent antimicrobial use, robust infection prevention, innovation in therapy, and public education can the looming threat of a post-antibiotic era be averted.

        <h3>A better today, for best tomorrow </h3>
        <p> "No matter what happens or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be a better tomorrow"☘

Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth🍁. 

You never know what the person is going through, you never know how the other one feels. It's just what you see or maybe sometimes you don't even see. 🍃

Failure is always a first step for something great achievement. It's hard to deal with failure, and even the thought of failing, when you fail whole world feels apart. 🥀

People are going through lots of problems but you never know what are things going inside their mind. 🌺

It's always your perspective about the person🧠 

Learn to talk to the person, learn to deal with failure, learn how to handle problems because that's what life is about...

                      "A BALANCE"🫀

Make a balance of failure and success, try not to under estimate the people around you. Before mocking down anyone just think and talk to that person. Maybe the problem is just in your mind and not in that other person. ⚡

You always can't just keep getting success in life, you have to go through failure to get successful in life because when you fail-you think, you try to get better day by day. 🚀

A failure shouldn't define you, let everyone think what they think...it's their job to create issues in everybody's life. But you are a soldier who can't get defeated so easily just by other's opinion♨️. 

You will fail 1000 times, you will be mocked 1000 times but it's your responsibility to get up and get out of the league and to create a legacy. For a better tomorrow you have to work today.🌥 

The only option is to ignore the freaking world and keep going because nobody cares about your failure or success. It's just they get a chance to judge and let them continue the shit they are made for. 🌸

If you know you are putting your best, don't think about the result, it will be best and even if you fail after giving your 100%, just remember that is also a success and a chance to be better now. 🌏

If you are struggling with things right now, just remember that there will be a clear sky after the thunderstorm, take good care of your self, take good sleep, rock your days. YOUR LIFE MATTERS ❤
